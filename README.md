# Uset and Sset Implementation code in Python
## Sset and Uset
There are two files namely `sset.py` and `uset.py` which contain the implementation of both data structures in python. There are also `test` files for you to check if your code is working correctly.

## Bag Implementation 
In order to furthur our understanding of the two given data structures I have performed a question from [Open Data Structures by Pat Morin](http://opendatastructures.org/). This will give us a better idea of how these data structures can be used. The following is **Exercise 1.5**
>Exercise 1.5. Using a USet, implement a Bag. A Bag is like a USet—it supports
the add(x), remove(x) and find(x) methods—but it allows duplicate
elements to be stored. The find(x) operation in a Bag returns some element
(if any) that is equal to x. In addition, a Bag supports the find all(x)
operation that returns a list of all elements in the Bag that are equal to x.
